# GDScript Docs Maker #

Docs Maker is a set of tools to convert documentation you write inside your code to an online or offline code reference in the markdown format.

If you make plugins or a framework for Godot, GDScript Docs Maker will help you save a lot of time documenting your code.

It creates documents following Godot's built-in class reference. You can see an example with our [Godot Steering Toolkit documentation](https://www.gdquest.com/docs/godot-steering-toolkit/reference/)

**Note**: This program requires Godot 3.2+ and Python 3.7+ to work.

## Installing ##

You can install GDScript Docs Maker with pip:

```bash
# On Linux and MacOS:
python3 -m pip install gdscript_docs_maker

# On Windows, if you installed Python 3.7+, you can use:
python -m pip install gdscript_docs_maker
```

## Getting Started ##

In this section, we're showing you how to use the program to generate a code reference quickly.

You need to:

1. Write docstrings inside your GDScript code.
2. Use one of the shell programs that ships with this add-on.

### Writing your code reference ###

Document properties and functions with comment blocks placed on the line before their definition:

```gdscript
# A linear and angular amount of acceleration.
class_name GSTTargetAcceleration


# Linear acceleration
var linear: = Vector3.ZERO
# Angular acceleration
var angular: = 0.0


# Resets the accelerations to zero
func reset() -> void:
	linear = Vector3.ZERO
	angular = 0.0
```

Your docstrings can be as long as you want.

### Generating the markdown files ###

We wrote two shell scripts to automate the steps in generating a code reference: `./generate_reference.sh` for Linux or MacOS, and `./generate_reference.bat` for Windows.

Use either of them to quickly generate your code reference:

```bash
generate_reference

Generate a code reference from GDScript.

Usage:

generate_reference $project_directory (optional)$output_directory

Arguments:

$project_directory -- path to your Godot project directory.
This directory or one of its subdirectories should contain a
project.godot file.
$output_directory -- directory path to output the documentation into.

Flags:

-h/--help -- Display this help message.
```

You need `godot` to be available on the system PATH.

## Hugo output ##

You can output markdown files for [hugo](https://gohugo.io/), the static website engine.

To do so, call GDScript docs maker with the `--format hugo` option. You can use two extra flags with this:

```bash
--date YYYY-MM-DD, the date in iso format, if you want the documents to have a date other than today. Default: datetime.date.today()
--author author_id, the id of the author on your hugo website, to assign an the author for the documents. Default: ""
```

Here's how I generate the Godot Steering Toolkit's documentation. This command outputs the class reference straight into the website:

```bash
python3 -m gdscript_docs_maker $HOME/Repositories/godot-steering-toolkit/project/reference.json --format hugo --author razoric --path $HOME/Repositories/website/content/docs/godot-steering-toolkit/reference/classes/
```

## The manual way ##

If you want to generate the JSON and convert it manually, there are three steps involved:

1. Copying the GDScript files `./godot-scripts/Collector.gd` and `./godot-scripts/ReferenceCollectorCLI.gd` or `./godot-scripts/ReferenceCollectorCLI.gd` to your Godot 3.2 project.
2. Running the GDScript code with Godot, either from the editor (`ReferenceCollector.gd`) or by calling Godot from the command line (`ReferenceCollectorCLI.gd`).
3. Running `gdscript_docs_maker` on the reference.json file that Godot generated in the previous step.

<!-- TODO: turn into a note block on the website. -->
**Note**: to parse and collect data from GDScript code, we rely on the GDScript language server that's new in Godot 3.2.

### Converting JSON ###

Call the `gdscript-docs-maker` package directly using the `python -m` option:

```
Usage: gdscript_docs_maker [-h] [-p PATH] [-v] [--dry-run] files [files ...]

Merges or converts json data dumped by Godot's GDScript language server to
create a code reference.

positional arguments:
  files                 A list of paths to JSON files.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit.
  -p PATH, --path PATH  Path to the output directory.
  -v, --verbose         Set the verbosity level. For example, -vv sets the
                        verbosity level to 2. Default: 0.
  --dry-run             Run the script without creating
                        files and folders. For debugging purposes.
```

The program takes a list of JSON files. For example, we generate the code reference of our AI framework [Godot Steering Toolkit](https://github.com/GDQuest/godot-steering-toolkit/) like so with the shell:

```fish
python -m gdscript-docs-maker ~/Repositories/godot-steering-toolkit/src/reference.json
```
